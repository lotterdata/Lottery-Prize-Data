Lottery-Prize-Data
==================

Historical winning numbers and prize amounts for parimutuel lotteries.

Lottery players tend to select the numbers they play in non-random ways. For example, they choose family birthdays, make patterns on the play slip number grid, and choose 7 and 11 disproportionately often. Unfortunately, data on players' selections are not generally available. However, we can get some insight by looking at the prize amounts from parimutuel lotteries, because when the lottery draws popular numbers the prize amount are small since many people have entered the drawing with those numbers. This repository provides data for modeling prizes as a function of the selected numbers. There is also a folder with sales data, which is available for a few games.

WARNING: Some of these data sets exhibit anomalies resulting from idiosyncratic game rules, as well as changes to these rules. Be sure to do some exploratory data analysis before jumping into your modeling, and consult the relevant lottery websites as needed.
